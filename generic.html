								<p>I truly believe that possibilities are endless and learning never ends.</p>

									When I graduated from college, I was fascinated with how financial products work. This led me to my first professional role at one of Vietnam's top local banks as a member of the core team that launched the bank's first-ever credit card. I served as the main point of contact for the bank and the Visa team. My role was to facilitate a smooth delivery which I am proud to say I did. I was also in charge of the card system's reconciliation and chargeback features.
									
								<p>	Once the card was successfully launched, I was ready for my next opportunity. I decided to apply for my MBA in the U.K. I saw this as a chance to step out of my comfort zone and live fully immersed in another culture. I knew I would learn a lot studying side-by-side with classmates from all over the world and I did. Beyond life learning, I discovered my passion for marketing while in the MBA program.</p>
									
								<p>	Upon completion of my MBA, I moved back to Vietnam and started working for Shinhan Bank as a Product Marketing Specialist. I combined my previous banking experience with my new marketing skills to manage multiple business-building campaigns. In my role, I leveraged the data available from existing databases to analyze customer spending behavior and realized the power of data-driven decision-making. This exposure led me to my newest career direction.....Data Analytics. So far I have learned SQL, R, Tableau, and Google Studio. I am currently learning Python. I have done this through self-study while also making my next big geographic move....to the U.S. (Houston, Texas to be exact!)</p>
									
								<p>	I am ready to apply my education, professional experience in product development and marketing, problem-solving expertise, cultural awareness, and new data/programming skills to my next opportunity. Please email me at chi.tran.tkh@gmail.com | khanh.chi168@gmail.com to talk about how I might apply these skills to your open opportunity.</p>
